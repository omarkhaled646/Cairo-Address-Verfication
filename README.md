# Cairo Address Verification

## Overview

Cairo Address Verification is an HTTP API that takes an address name and checks if it exists in Cairo or not using an LSTM Deep Learning Mode.

## Building the Docker Image

<!-- Create a button and wrap your command in a pre tag with an id -->
<button onclick="copyToClipboard('#your-command')">Copy</button>

<pre id="your-command">
# Your command here
echo "Hello, world!"
</pre>

<script>
  function copyToClipboard(elementId) {
    var copyText = document.querySelector(elementId);
    var range = document.createRange();
    range.selectNode(copyText);
    window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
    window.getSelection().addRange(range);
    document.execCommand('copy');
    window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
  }
</script>
